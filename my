Rich Dad, Poor Dad

INTRODUCTION
There is a Need
Does school prepare children for the real world? “y hard and get good
grades and you will find a high-paying job with great benefits,” my parents used
to say. Their goal in life was to provide a college education for my older sister
and me, so that we would have the greatest chance for success in life. When T
finally earned my diploma in 1976-graduating with honors, and near the top of
my class, in accounting from Florida State University-my parents had realized
their goal. It was the crowning achievement of their lives. In accordance with the
“Master Plan,” I was hired by a “Big 8” accounting firm, and I looked forward to
a long career and retirement at an early age.
My husband, Michael, followed a similar path. We both came from hard?
working families, of modest means but with strong work ethics. Michael also
graduated with honors, but he did it twice: first as an engineer and then from law
school. He was quickly recruited by a prestigious Washington, D.C., law firm
that specialized in patent law, and his future seemed bright, cardbfiuhfwiueer path welldefined and early retirement guaranteed.
